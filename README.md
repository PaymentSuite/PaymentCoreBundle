About Payment Suite
-----

The Symfony2 Payment Suite is just a way to implement any payment platform for Symfony2 based E-commerce, with a common structure. Your project will simply need to listen to a few events, so the method of payment will be fully transparent.

    + Payment platforms
    - Headaches
    = Code
    + Time, Life

The philosophy that leads us to do this project is simply no need to repeat in every project the same lines of code ( yes, we love Open Source ). We want every E-commerce based in Symfony2 to meet us, to join us and contribute to new platform.
